# buzz-off-reddit

Reddit sneakily inserts tracking links into your internal clicks.

While they made every effort to hide the fact from the user, it's not hidden from anti-tracking extensions, like uBlock. As a result, middle clicking a comments link results in a new tab getting killed immediately.

This extension fixes an underlying problem by cleaning those damn attributes.

Buzz off, Reddit!

# How to use

Clone, enable developer mode in `chrome://extensions` and add extension from dir.

# Why not publish it?

I'm not likely to have any use of Chrome Web Store, so I'm not going to pay 5$ to publish something that I created for myself. If you have a problem that this extension fixes, then you shouldn't be afraid to get your hands dirty anyways.
